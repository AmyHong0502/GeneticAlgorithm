// start by creating a group of cities.

// and a RANDOM set of coordinates.

// Create a population of tours.
// Each tour must contain the entire list of cities sorted randomly.
// i.e.
// We will have a data structure that manages a collection of tours
// each tour will manage a sequence of the cities on the map that begins in a
// randomly shuffled state.

// make a note of the shortest, i.e. fittest, tour.
